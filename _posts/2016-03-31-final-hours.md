<h3>Thank you!</h3>

This campaign has been a whirlwind, and it's coming to a close today at 9pm EST. Only a few hours left! Thank you so much for your support - pledges, shares, kind messages, and so much more. We've received pledges for over 110,000 Higher Hangers and we couldn't be happier! 

This is your last chance to change your pledge on Kickstarter if you've decided you would like more! Following our Kickstarter close, Higher Hangers will be available for continued pre-order/direct purchase at HigherHangers.com.

Thank you so much for everything! I look forward to visiting the factory soon and being hands on throughout the manufacturing and delivery process.
