The most unique feature of Higher Hangers is their patented recessed hook. They simply hang your clothes higher than any other hanger on the market. Look at your closet. Do you see the distance between the top of your shirt and the top of your hanger hooks? It’s wasted space! 
                    
Do your clothes wrinkle, not allow a spot for some shoes, or does it just feel cluttered? You don’t need a bigger closet; there is room available when using Higher Hangers!

Higher Hangers raise your clothes 4 inches or more versus traditional clothes hangers. This space-savings is multiplied if you only have one closet rod. Would you like a 2nd closet rod, but don’t have room for one? In many cases, when using Higher Hangers in a closet with one rod, you now have the space required to fit a second adjustable closet rod to double your hanging space.
