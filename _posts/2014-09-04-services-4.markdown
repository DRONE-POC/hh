People often incorrectly expect one drawback to Higher Hangers: they think that Higher Hangers won't work with collared shirts. Actually, Higher Hangers are carefully designed to allow for enough clearance for your collared shirts (take a look for yourself). Higher Hangers will work with any kind of clothing you would normally use with a traditional clothes hanger: pants, tee shirts, collared shirts, jackets, anything you can think of.
