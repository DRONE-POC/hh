Great news! Manufacturing went according to plan, and the first run of Higher Hangers are loaded on a boat bound for the USA. From there they will go to a fulfillment warehouse that should be able to perform a quick turnaround and get them out the door by the end of June. We are still right on schedule!

In celebration of getting over 100,000 Higher Hangers on the boat, please vote for Higher Hangers in the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest. You can vote every 24 hours until June 13th.
