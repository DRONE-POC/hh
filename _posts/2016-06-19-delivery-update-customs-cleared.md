Higher Hangers have cleared customs! 

Great news! As of 6/19 everything has cleared customs and we are working to get the inventory from the port to the warehouse, receive it, and ship out to our backers! We're hoping to ship by the end of June. 

If you are a Kickstarter backer and haven't filled out your survey information, please do so that we can have your shipping information (about 12% of backers have not yet). You can still edit your address information if needed and we'll send out a "last call" before shipping, and then you will receive notification when your order ships.
