We made Kickstarter history, and I almost missed it. Someone pointed this out to me over the weekend: **Higher Hangers have raised more money than any other clothes hangers in Kickstarter history.** Not only that, but we've raised more money than all the others *combined*.


There have been many attempts over the years to launch a new hanger design on Kickstarter, and I have have a few theories why products like this face an uphill battle. Most fizzle out and die, but thanks to you we've made Higher Hangers a huge success. 

In fact, we broke the record within 48 hours of launching on Kickstarter. Bucking the trend like this doesn't happen often, so I thought about what makes Higher Hangers different from all the rest. This infographic is what I came up with:
