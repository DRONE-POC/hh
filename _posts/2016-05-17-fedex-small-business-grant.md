FedEx accepted Higher Hangers into their [$25,000 small business grant contest](http://smallbusinessgrant.fedex.com/Gallery/Detail/2251c6cd-592d-424a-998d-05b56ccb587e){:target='_blank'}. You can vote once per 24 hour period. I would appreciate your votes and sharing our campaign! It's super fast and simple to drop your vote in for Higher Hangers. 

This will help us with cashflow to continue manufacturing as we've nearly sold-out of all excess inventory that was pre-ordered after Kickstarter. Thank you so much!
