"Why didn't I think of that?"

On Tuesday, March 15th, Higher Hangers were featured on Denver's NBC 9News TechTuesday segment. [You can view the video clip and original article here.](http://www.9news.com/tech/techtuesday-colorado-inventor-rethinks-the-simple-hanger/83380287){:target='_blank'}

Greg Moss, 9News: "*It has irritated me for the longest...because your suits drag on the floor, and there's [never been] a way to get around that. That's brilliant!*"
