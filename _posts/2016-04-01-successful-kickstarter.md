Wow, I can't believe it. We started our Kickstarter campaign last month with a goal of $40,000. Thanks to your support, shares, and backing, we were able to raise $148,885 to make Higher Hangers a reality. 

I will work on shipping the first 50 Super Early Bird backers their rewards in the next few days, and then I will visit my manufacturer and finalize manufacturing and delivery for the rest of you. I still expect to be able to get all rewards shipped out by the end of June.

Thanks for your help, now I'm off to work on getting you your Higher Hangers!
