With all the advantages of Higher Hangers, the traditional clothes hanger is obsolete. You sacrifice none of the flexibility of a traditional clothes hanger while gaining tons of space in your closet. Even if you don't reorganize your closet right away, the space you save will never go away. You can take advantage of it at any point in time without sacrificing the normal utility of traditional clothes hangers.
