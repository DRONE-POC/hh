Thanks to Teen Vogue for including Higher Hangers in their "[Graduation Gift Ideas Wish List](http://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/graduation-gift-ideas-wish-list#6){:target='_blank'}."

Higher Hangers are a great graduation gift idea for high school students. I invented Higher Hangers because of my cramped closet and living space in college. If anyone can benefit from Higher Hangers, it's college students.
