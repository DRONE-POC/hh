Drew realized that if he redesigned the top portion of the hanger he could significantly raise the hanger, freeing up more space below his clothes. After cutting the old hanger to pieces and using a lighter to melt the new design back together, he created the very first Higher Hangers prototype. Using the new hanger, his clothes no longer dragged along the ground, and he freed up enough space to move a dresser into his closet underneath the top row of clothes.
