Your closet will benefit from freeing up more vertical space, space that is literally dead and unusable right now. What will your closet look like with Higher Hangers supporting all of your clothes? Perhaps you couldâ€¦

- Double your closet capacity by adding additional clothes rods to hang more clothes
- Make an easy-to-access shoe rack by hanging some simple shelves underneath the upper row of clothes
- Slide a dresser under the top row
- Avoid wrinkled clothes hanging down onto the floor or into the row beneath
- Rebuild your whole closet around the space savings you gain by using Higher Hangers
