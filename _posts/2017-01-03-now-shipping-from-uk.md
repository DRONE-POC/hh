In addition to our primary warehouse in California, we are excited to announce that we are now stocking Higher Hangers in a second warehouse in the UK. This means that shipping costs are now significantly lower for customers in the UK and Europe. 

Your shipping costs will be automatically calculated based on your shipping address when you add items to your shopping cart. [Click here to go to our online store](https://shop.higherhangers.com) and see how low the new shipping rates are to the UK and Europe.
