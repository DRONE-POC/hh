Redesigning the clothes hanger this way seemed like such an obvious solution to a common problem that Drew assumed someone had thought of it before. When he couldn't find another similar hanger, he applied for a patent. Expecting a long, complicated process, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted all patent claims the first time through the system, a rare occurrence, and awarded Drew patent 7,404,503. Now is your chance to buy these patented space-saving hangers for your home.
