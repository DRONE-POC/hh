<h3>48 Hours to Go!</h3>

We'll be locking down shipping address changes in 48 hours. Please update your shipping address if anything has changed. We're hoping to start shipping by the end of the week or early next week.

Kickstarter and BackerKit customers should receive another email through BackerKit about how to update your address. 

Those who purchased through HigherHangers.com can edit your address via the link in your order confirmation email. 

Thanks for your help!!!
