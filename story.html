                    <p class="lead">One evening in college, Drew Cleaver looked into the closet of his 139 square foot college dorm room and saw a mess. It was crammed full with clothes squished between the upper and lower closet rods, the upper rack overflowing onto the clothes underneath and the bottom row dragging on the floor. With all the unused vertical space in the closet, he knew he could create a better way to hang his clothes. He took an existing clothes hanger, some pliers, and a lighter, and started hacking awayâ€¦</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">That Evening He Invented Higher Hangers</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Drew realized that if he redesigned the top portion of the hanger he could significantly raise the hanger, freeing up more space below his clothes. After cutting the old hanger to pieces and using a lighter to melt the new design back together, he created the very first Higher Hangers prototype. Using the new hanger, his clothes no longer dragged along the ground, and he freed up enough space to move a dresser into his closet underneath the top row of clothes.
</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">How Did Someone Not Think of This Already?</h2>
<p class="lead">Redesigning the clothes hanger this way seemed like such an obvious solution to a common problem that Drew assumed someone had thought of it before. When he couldn't find another similar hanger, he applied for a patent. Expecting a long, complicated process, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted all patent claims the first time through the system, a rare occurrence, and awarded Drew patent 7,404,503. Now is your chance to buy these patented space-saving hangers for your home.</p>
