## Kickstarter

Higher Hangers will be available to pre-order on the Kickstarter website beginning March 1. If you are unfamiliar with Kickstarter, I have answered some of the most common questions below.

### What is Kickstarter?

From their website:

>Kickstarter helps artists, musicians, filmmakers, designers, and other creators find the resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality. To date, tens of thousands of creative projects — big and small — have come to life with the support of the Kickstarter community.

Basically, it works like this: creators (like me) make a project that needs money in order to get off the ground (like Higher Hangers) and set a goal to raise a certain amount of money by a certain date. Individuals (like you) find projects they want to support and contribute money towards those projects. This is called "backing" a project in Kickstarter language, and you become a "backer." Backers get certain "rewards" based on how much they pledge to the project (in the case of Higher Hangers, your rewards are Higher Hangers).

If the project hits its fundraising goal, Kickstarter charges your credit card and gives that money to the creator in order to fund their project. For Higher Hangers, I will use that money to manufacture the first batch of Higher Hangers and ship them to you. You are pre-ordering Higher Hangers by backing me on Kickstarter. 

If the goal is not met, then Kickstarter doesn't even charge your credit card.

### Is Kickstarter Safe?

Kickstarter is the most popular crowdfunding website in the world. To date:

* Kickstarter has helped creators raise $2.2 billion
* There have been 100,000 successful projects on Kickstarter
* Over 10 million people have backed projects on Kickstarter
* If a project does not meet their fundraising goal, your credit card does not get charged
