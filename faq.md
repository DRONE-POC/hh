### How do Higher Hangers work? 

The design of clothes hangers has been wrong since they were invented over 100 years ago and nobody thought to change it until we patented an entirely new design. We lowered the hook to raise clothes higher to hang close to shirt collars so that Higher Hangers don’t waste any space for no reason.

### What are they made of? 

Higher Hangers are available in 2 premium styles. Black velvet flocked (non-slip) slimline, and clean, luxurious white HDF wood*, both with chrome metal hooks. 

### Do collared shirts work on Higher Hangers?

Absolutely. We maximized the design to save space but allowed just enough room for shirt collars so Higher Hangers could be used for every type of clothing. Higher Hangers have gone through XX design revisions before finalizing the current design. Ease-of-use and versatility among all types of clothing were the highest priority. 

### Will the velvet material get on my clothes?

No way. We tested several manufacturers to make sure we found the highest quality manufacturer, so the velvet coating keeps your clothes from slipping off, but always stays on the hangers. 

### What is HDF material?

HDF (high density fiberboard) has been used for years in high quality wood flooring for its superb durability. HDF is now being used for hangers, and Higher Hangers are the first HDF hangers in the United States bringing all the qualities of wood hangers (thick, durable, & aesthetic) at a price that everyone can afford. They are perfect for dress shirts where non-slip isn’t a priority.
