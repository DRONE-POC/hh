title: What is HDF material?
---

"Solid wood" hangers are actually 2-3 pieces of solid wood glued together near the hook which creates a weak point. HDF hangers are one solid piece (plus the hook). High-density fiberboard (HDF), is an engineered composite wood product that's been used in wood flooring for years but just now being used to make hangers. HDF allows for all the qualities of solid-wood hangers (thick, durable, gorgeous), for a fraction of the price. I wouldn't try to snap one over my leg like a baseball bat. They're stout. Unlike particle board, HDF will not split or crack.
HDF is way stronger, denser, and harder than particle board or MDF (medium-density fiberboard) because it is made out of exploded wood fibers that have been highly compressed.
