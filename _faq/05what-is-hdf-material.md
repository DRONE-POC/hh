title: What is HDF material? (Used in faux wood hangers)
---

HDF (high density fiberboard) has been used for years in high quality wood flooring for its superb durability. HDF is now being used for hangers, and Higher Hangers are the first HDF hangers in the United States bringing all the qualities of wood hangers (thick, durable, & aesthetic) at a price that everyone can afford. They are perfect for dress shirts where non-slip isnâ€™t a priority.
