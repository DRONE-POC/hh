title: Do collared shirts work on Higher Hangers?
---

Absolutely. We maximized the design to save space but allowed just enough room for shirt collars so Higher Hangers could be used for every type of clothing. Higher Hangers have gone through XX design revisions before finalizing the current design. Ease-of-use and versatility among all types of clothing were the highest priority.
