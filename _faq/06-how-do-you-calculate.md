title: 48 shoeboxes of new space? How do you calculate that?
---

Put your math hat on... 

A very popular clear shoe storage box for women on Amazon.com has dimensions of 11.8 x 7.4 x 3.8 inches. To make the math simpler, I round everything to 12 x 8 x 4 inches. Higher Hangers *raise* your clothes 4 inches compared to a traditional clothes hanger, making enough new space to slide a 4 inch tall shoebox underneath. The average closet is 24 inches deep, which means you can now fit two 12 inch long shoeboxes every 8 inches (the boxes are 8 inches wide). That comes out to two shoeboxes every <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of a foot (8 inches), four shoeboxes every 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> feet (16 inches), or six shoeboxes every 2 feet (24 inches).

The average closet dimensions are four feet wide per person. For two person closets, like in your master bedroom, you will have an 8 foot wide closet. Assuming you have both and an upper and lower row of clothes, that gives you 16 total feet of hanging space. 

Multiply everything out and with 16 feet of hanging space you create enough new space in your closet to be able to store 48 shoeboxes worth of stuff.

Many people with walk-in closets will have much more hanging space. If you want to measure your own hanging space and get the numbers for yourself, <a href="sb.html#calculator">click here to use my space-savings calculator</a>.
