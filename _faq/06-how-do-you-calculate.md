title: 48 shoeboxes of new space? How do you calculate that?
---

It’s very simple math. Here’s how…

1) One of the most popular shoe storage boxes on Amazon.com has dimensions of 11.8” (deep) x 7.4” (wide) x 3.8” (tall). 

2) To make the math more simple and realistic, I round everything up to 12 x 8 x 4 inches. We know in reality there will be some space between each box, so we’re hurting our own statistics with honesty. 

3) Higher Hangers *raise* your clothes at 4 inches compared to traditional clothes hangers, making enough new space to slide a 4 inch tall shoebox underneath. 

4) The average closet is at least 24 inches deep, which means you can now fit two 12 inch long shoeboxes front to back for every 8 inches wide of hanging space (since boxes are 8 inches wide). That comes out to six shoeboxes every 2 feet (24 inches).

5) The *average* closet size for a two person closet, like in your master bedroom, is 8 feet wide. Most people have both and an upper and lower row of clothes, so that equals 16 feet of total hanging space. 

6) Multiply everything out and with 16 feet of hanging space and Higher Hangers create over **10 cubic feet** of new space in an *average* closet. That’s enough for **48 shoeboxes**, or **at least 13 carry-on pieces of luggage** (using the max allowed dimensions of major airlines). It’s also the size of a European-style refrigerator (5ft tall x 2ft wide). 

Our formula = Total Amount of Hanging Space In Feet divided by .333 (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>) Feet (4 inches, half the 8” shoebox width since there are 2 shoeboxes deep). That’s it. 

If we were an *As Seen on TV company*, we’d just use the dishonest, raw dimensions (step 1), and the total actual space savings is equivalent to about 52 shoe boxes.

Many people with walk-in closets have much more hanging space. Measure your own hanging space by just grabbing a tape measure and adding up your closet rod lengths to see how much you can save with Higher Hangers, then use the space-savings calculator below to find out how much new space you can create.
