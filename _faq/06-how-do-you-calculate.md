title: 48 shoeboxes of new space? How do you calculate that?

It’s very simple math. Here’s how…

1) One of the most popular shoe storage boxes on Amazon.com has dimensions of 11.8” (deep) x 7.4” (wide) x 3.8” (tall). 

2) To make the math realistic, I round everything up to 12 x 8 x 4 inches. We know in reality there will be some space between each box, so I'm hurting my own statistics with honesty. 

3) Higher Hangers *raise* your clothes 4 inches compared to traditional hangers, creating enough new space to slide a 4 inch tall shoebox underneath. 

4) The average closet is at least 24 inches deep, which means you can now fit two 12 inch long shoeboxes front to back for every 8 inches wide of hanging space (since boxes are 8 inches wide). That comes out to six shoeboxes every 2 feet (24 inches).

5) The *average* closet size for a two person closet, like in your master bedroom, is 8 feet wide. Most people have both and an upper and lower row of clothes, so that equals 16 feet of total hanging space. 

6) Multiply everything out and with 16 feet of hanging space Higher Hangers create over **10 cubic feet** of new space in an *average* closet. That’s enough for **48 shoeboxes**, or **about 7 carry-on pieces of luggage**. It’s also the size of a European-style refrigerator (5ft tall x 2ft wide). 

Many walk-in closets have more than 16 feet of hanging space. Grab a tape measure, add up your closet rod lengths, then use the space-savings calculator below to see how much new space Higher Hangers can create in your closet.
